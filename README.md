# Vionora: Personalized Supplement Recommender

Vionora is a personalized supplement recommendation quiz designed to help users optimize their health and wellness routines. By collecting user input across various lifestyle and health categories, the application uses rules-based logic to provide tailored supplement suggestions. The project merges my interest in wellness with software design, creating a real-world application that feels both purposeful and professionally presented.


## Goal & MVP

Goal: Help users discover science-backed supplements aligned with their specific goals — from improving sleep and managing stress to supporting digestion and skin health.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

- A dynamic web app built with Flask

- A user-friendly quiz interface with styled HTML/CSS and JavaScript

- Personalized results based on user input

Stretch Goals (for future versions):

- AI-driven recommendations

- User accounts and data storage

- Supplement brand integration (affiliate links, APIs)
## How it Works

1. Frontend:

- Clean, luxury-inspired design with a dark mode theme

- Responsive quiz interface styled with custom CSS

- JavaScript functionality for expand/collapse sections to improve UX

2. Backend:

- Built with Python using the Flask framework

- Uses POST requests to collect quiz data and process logic

- Rules-based logic determines supplement recommendations based on input

- Results are dynamically rendered on a styled results page

3. Data:

- Recommendations include: supplement name, use case, benefit, dosage, and science-based explanation

- All logic is contained in a Python dictionary and processed on form submission
